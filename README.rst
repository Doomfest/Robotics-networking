ROBOTICS NETWORKING
========

Robotics networking stuff.

To install, run:

    python2.7 setup.py install --user

This will make a user install. Make sure your environment sees executables in
the local path.

Then you can start the server using the following command (this is the
executable that comes along with this library):

    roboticsnet-test

And if you want to give a few things a shot manually, you can test with the
client executable

    roboticsnet-client


Overall Setup
=============

For the moment this is how things should look like:
