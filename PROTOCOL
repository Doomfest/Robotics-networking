ROVER PROTOCOLS
===============

A 'number' is an integer, positive, or negative. We use integers for movement,
and wheel rotation (rotation for turns).

  Number is a negative, or positive integer. Limits for now are up to 255.
    number ::= (-)[0-9]+

  Movement forward/backward:
    move <number>

  Rotate wheels:
    turn <number>
